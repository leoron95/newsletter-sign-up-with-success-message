## Features

<!-- List the features of your application or follow the template. Don't share the figma file here :) -->

This site was created as a submission to a [frontendmentor](https://frontendmentor.io/challenges) challenge. The [challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/newsletter-signup-form-with-success-message-3FC1AZbNrv) was to build out this landing page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The users should be able to:

- Add their email and submit the form
- See a success message with their email after successfully submitting the form
- See form validation messages if:
  - The field is left empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
